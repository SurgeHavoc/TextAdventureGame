# TextAdventureGame

## Description
A small text-console game in which a user can "travel" to different locations and play the game through text input. In this text-based adventure, embark on an epic journey through the mysterious Dark Forest, the spanning grasslandplains, and the wavy desert dunes. The choices made will determine the path, the chance for treasure, and the danger that the player will face.

## Motivation
I made this game to help me learn a little bit more about C++ I/O. The concept of I/O was already familiar to me with C, which made the transition to C++ pretty easy. I wanted to take a narrative route for the type of game, so I had fun building out a short interactive story.

## What I Learned
- Mastered I/O.
- Learned about the <thread> and <chrono> libraries.

## Usage
### Starting the Game
Run the .exe using ./TextAdventure
### Controls
- Use the number keys to make choices.
### Gameplay
- Each "scene" provides choices to make, influencing the narrative.
- Player can engage in "combat" with a pre-determined outcome.
If the player chooses wisely, then the player can complete the game.
## Credits
- I worked on this project solo.
